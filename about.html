            <p>I am a 3D designer based in Oslo. Currently i am doing all sorts of 
                generalized 3D, such as modelling, texturing, animation, architectural 
                visualiztion, product design, game dev, game design and much more. 
                However there has been a small shift toward architecture lately. This 
                means that i will try to focus a bit more on this branch, making 
                this my specialization.</p>

            <p>Before i started working with 3D graphics i used to be a dancer, with 
                starting my bachelors degree in contemporary dance at The National 
                Academy of the Arts, Oslo. During my time there, i figured i still 
                wanted to do something creative, but slightly less physical and 
                something that could last even longer than just a brief hour on 
                stage. The start of my 3D adventure started when i was creating my own 
                performance and i needed some 3D floating text. After sitting and 
                watching some tutorials i truly fel in love. Two years after this 
                experience i started on my actual bachelors degree in 3D graphics at 
                HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania/Westerdals.</p>

            <p>If you are hiring or just curious, you are most likely wondering which 
                software i am using. The answer is a bit complicated. </p>

            <p>But here is a list of the ones i am most comfortable with:
                <ul>
                    <li>3Ds max (vRay, Arnold)</li>
                    <li>Blender (cycles, Eevee)</li>
                    <li>zBrush</li>
                    <li>Substance Painter and Designer</li>
                    <li>Unity</li>
                    <li>Photoshop</li>
                    <li>Meshroom (photoscans)</li>
                    <li>Sony Vegas</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
